# VetCalc

</p>

VetCalc is a social network for the veterinary industry where users can save, share and calculate drug doses. The calculator provides a visualisation of the amount of tablets or liquid required per dose, allowing for more informed decisions when selecting drug concentration. A label is automatically generated and can be texted directly to the client, reducing communication errors.
Users can save other vets' preferred doses to their own page for future reference. While nurses can prescribe according to a vetâ€™s preferences, they cannot save their own doses. Interaction between users is enabled through private messaging and following.
VetCalc saves vets approximately 5 hours a week and reduces medical mistakes.

## Motivation

As a practicing veterinarian, I was frustrated with the amount of time I spent looking up drug doses. Once I would find a dose I liked, if I didn't use it for a while, I would need to look it up all over again. 
Deciding on a drug dose isn't as simple as just consulting a textbook. Usually the textbook ranges are quite large and it can be difficult to decide where to go within the range. Deciding on a dose often involves consulting multiple texbooks (since they can all have different ranges) and consulting with colleagues or specialists from other hospitals on what their preferred dose is.
Both vets and nurses are responsible for calculating the actual amount of drug required for a given dose, which can lead to another subset of complications regarding miscalculations. For example, overdosing or underdosing or not sending the correct total amount of drug home with the patient. Mistakes made here can have severe consequences.

## How to use

## Features

### Complex database model
There is a lot that goes into deciding on a drug dose and I really wanted my database to reflect this.
I spent a long time thinking about and working through an ideal datamodel. In the time I had for the scoped version of this project, there wasn't enough time to implement every table and feature I wanted, but I plan to continue working towards the more complex version after Hackbright.

####The ideal datamodel:
I will be working towards having a datamodel more like this in the future.

### Autocomplete searching using a trie
Since drug names can be difficult to spell, I wanted to implement an autocomplete search. I researched and implemented a data structure called a trie. <a href="https://hackerfall.com/story/autocomplete-using-tries">This tutorial</a> was a really helpful guide in making some practice tries before adding them to my real site. After I added the first one to the main drug search page, I thought it was so much fun that I had to add it to the other pages too. I added extra nodes to the user search page to allow searching by first name, last name or username.

### Private messaging with Socketio
Private messaging is implemented with socketio and javascript in the frontend and flask-socketio in the backend. This was quite difficult to deploy, as the sockets communicate with http, but the site is deployed with https. The sockets also kept defaulting to long polling, which made for an extremely unpleasant messaging experience!

### Infinite scroll
To trigger the AJAX request for the infinite scroll, I added an event listener that detects when the user scrolls to the top of the page. When the request is sent to the server a paginated database query retrieves next 10 messages. When no messages are left to be returned, a "No more messages" notification appears at the top.

### Message notifications
When a message is emitted to a chat room, users that are connected to the socket emit a confirmation back to the server. If a confirmation is sent by the message recipient, then the seen status is updated in the database to true. If the message recipient isn't connected to the socket, a confirmation is not sent and the seen status remains false in the database. The next time the user refreshes or reloads another page, a notification icon will show in their navbar. When a user loads a conversation, all the messages are set to seen.

Visualise the number of tablets required per dose. You can choose whether the tablets can be halved or quartered, or can only be taken whole.

### Editable instruction label
As you use the calculator page, the label instructions at the bottom update according to the state of the rest of the page. You can customize the label further before texting it to the client if there is extra information you want to include.

### Text label instructions to client
Labels are subject to degradation. They fade, become smudged and owners throw out the packaging. When label instructions are unclear or non-existent, an owner's reliance on memory drastically increases the risk of medical mistakes.

### Save preferred drug doses
Users can add their own preferred drug doses, which get stored in the personal_doses data table and displayed on their profile page.

### Save other vet's preferred drug doses

Users can save other user's doses to their own profile page for future reference. For example, 

[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/53b01d98daf4a21202b6795a4c9aeedd.gif)](https://gyazo.com/53b01d98daf4a21202b6795a4c9aeedd)

### User uploaded images with Pillow and Amazon S3 bucket
Users can upload their own profile pictures. The pictures are resized using the python library, Pillow into both thumbnail and a larger profile page size. They're then added to an Amazon S3 bucket.
Since a presigned url was being sent to S3 to retrieve the images every time they were needed from the site, it resulted in a lot of flickering. Which was particularly noticable in the chat. I extended the expiry date on the URLs and implemented client side caching to resolve this. 

### User permissions
Vets and nurses have distinct accounts. Veterinarians can utilize all features of the app. While nurses arae unable to set their own preferred doses, they can save preferred doses from the vets they work with. In the future I plan to build out this feature into special, vet-nurse connections where nurses can set who they are working with on a shift, and automatically get shown that vet's preferred doses.
