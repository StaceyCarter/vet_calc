VetCalc is a social network for the veterinary industry where users can save, share and calculate drug doses. The calculator provides a visualisation of the amount of tablets or liquid required per dose, allowing for more informed decisions when selecting drug concentration. A label is automatically generated and can be texted directly to the client, reducing communication errors.
Users can save other vets' preferred doses to their own page for future reference. While nurses can prescribe according to a vetâ€™s preferences, they cannot save their own doses. Interaction between users is enabled through private messaging and following.
VetCalc saves vets approximately 5 hours a week and reduces medical mistakes.

## Motivation

As a practicing veterinarian, I was frustrated with the amount of time I spent looking up drug doses. Once I would find a dose I liked, if I didn't use it for a while, I would need to look it up all over again. 
Deciding on a drug dose isn't as simple as just consulting a textbook. Usually the textbook ranges are quite large and it can be difficult to decide where to go within the range. Deciding on a dose often involves consulting multiple texbooks (since they can all have different ranges) and consulting with colleagues or specialists from other hospitals on what their preferred dose is.
Both vets and nurses are responsible for calculating the actual amount of drug required for a given dose, which can lead to another subset of complications regarding miscalculations. For example, overdosing or underdosing or not sending the correct total amount of drug home with the patient. Mistakes made here can have severe consequences.
