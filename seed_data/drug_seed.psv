enrofloxacin|Adsorbents and antacids containing cations (Mg2+, Al3+) may bind to fluoroquinolones and prevent their absorption from the GI tract. The absorption of fluoroquinolones may also be inhibited by sucralfate and zinc salts; separate doses of these drugs by at least 2 hours. Fluoroquinolones increase plasma theophylline concentrations. Cimetidine may reduce the clearance of fluoroquinolones and so should be used with caution in combination with these drugs.|Fluoroquinolones are relatively contraindicated in growing dogs and rabbits, as cartilage abnormalities have been reported in young dogs and rabbits (but not cats). Enrofloxacin is not authorized in cats <8 weeks of age; dogs <1 year of age; large-breed dogs <18 months of age
meloxicam|Do not administer concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides|Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Administration of meloxicam to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated and is not advisable in the perioperative period. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <6 weeks of age.
prednisolone|There is an increased risk of GI ulceration if used concurrently with NSAIDs. Hypokalaemia may develop if acetazolamide, amphotericin B or potassium-depleting diuretics (e.g. furosemide, thiazides) are administered concomitantly with corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids may antagonize the effect of insulin. The metabolism of corticosteroids may be enhanced by phenytoin or phenobarbital.|Do not use in pregnant animals. Systemic corticosteroids are generally contraindicated in patients with renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in ulcerative keratitis.
doxycycline|Do not administer Doxyseptin to dogs <15 kg. Do not administer to pregnant animals. Do not administer if there is evidence of oesophagitis or dysphagia.|Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Oesophagitis and oesophageal ulceration may develop; administer with food or a water bolus to reduce this risk. Administration during tooth development may lead to discoloration of the teeth, although the risk is less than with other tetracyclines.
amoxicillin/clavulanate (amoxycillin/clavulanic acid)|Avoid the concurrent use of amoxicillin with bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin). Do not mix in the same syringe as aminoglycosides. Do not use with allopurinol in birds. Synergism may occur between the beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antimicrobials in vivo.|Avoid oral antibiotic agents in critically ill patients, as absorption from the GI tract may be unreliable; such patients may require i.v. formulation. Avoid use in animals which have displayed hypersensitivity reactions to other antimicrobials within the beta-lactam family (which includes cephalosporins). Do not administer to hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chinchillas and rabbits.
carprofen|Different NSAIDs should not be administered within 24 hours of each other or glucocorticoids as they are more ulcerogenic when used concurrently. The nephrotoxic tendencies of all NSAIDs are significantly increased when administered concurrently with other nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides.|Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting abnormalities. Administration of carprofen to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated and is not advisable in the perioperative period. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <6 weeks old.
tramadol|Tramadol can be given in combination with other classes of analgesic drugs such as NSAIDs, amantadine, gabapentin and opioids. It has the potential to interact with drugs that inhibit central 5-HT and noradrenaline re-uptake such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. selegiline) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, causing serotonin syndrome that can result in seizures and death.|No information available
omeprazole|Omeprazole may enhance the effects of phenytoin|No information available
furosemide (frusemide)|Nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides may be potentiated when furosemide is also used. Furosemide may induce hypokalaemia, thereby increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity. Increased risk of hypokalaemia if furosemide given with acetazolamide, corticosteroids, thiazides and theophylline. The excretion of aspirin and furosemide may be reduced as they both compete for renal excretory sites; dose reduction may be required. Furosemide may inhibit the muscle relaxation qualities of tubocurarine, but increase the effects of suxamethonium.|Dehydration and anuria. Do not use in dehydrated or hyperuricaemic birds.
